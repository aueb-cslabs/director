Director is a service for computer laboratory management.

More to be added here soon!

## Running

To start the Flask application, while inside the project's directory, run:

```python
FLASK_ENV=development FLASK_APP=. flask run
```

Alternatively, to not repeat yourself, just run the `make` target:

```bash
make run
```

You can always replace the `run` with `shell`, to get a Flask interactive shell
instead of starting the server.
